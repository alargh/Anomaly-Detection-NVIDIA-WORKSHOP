# **Applications of AI for Anomaly Detection**

## **Overview**  
This repository contains my work for the **Applications of AI for Anomaly Detection** workshop, organised by NVIDIA. The workshop provided hands-on experience in detecting anomalies using AI-driven techniques in telecommunications network intrusion detection.

## **About the Workshop**  
The **Applications of AI for Anomaly Detection** workshop focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence to detect and classify anomalies in datasets. The course covers multiple approaches, including:  
- **Supervised Learning:** Using GPU-accelerated XGBoost for anomaly classification.  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Implementing deep learning-based autoencoders to detect anomalies without labeled data, then using **k-means clustering** to categorize results
- **Generative Models:** Applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data for anomaly detection.  

## **My Workshop Assessment**  
For my assessment, I worked on implementing two different anomaly detection techniques:  

### **1. Anomaly Detection Using XGBoost (Supervised Learning)**
- Prepared and processed network intrusion data for GPU acceleration.  
- Trained a **binary classifier** using XGBoost.  
- Evaluated model performance and fine-tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.  

### **2. Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoders (Unsupervised Learning)**
- Built and trained a **deep learning-based autoencoder** for detecting anomalies in unlabeled data.  
- Evaluated model performance and fine-tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy. 

## **Key Learnings & Takeaways**  
- Gained hands-on experience with **XGBoost and Autoencoders** for anomaly detection.  
- Learned the difference between **supervised and unsupervised approaches** for detecting anomalies.  
- Explored real-world applications of AI-driven anomaly detection in **cybersecurity, finance, and telecommunications**.
